##Overview

Our decentralised application allows users to post proof of good deeds, which are verified by peers and partnered NGOs. Verified contributions earn users tokens and badges, which they can proudly display on their LinkedIn profiles to bolster their community service credentials for college applications and goodwill. The tokens can be used to purchase online courses and resources, creating a valuable incentive for positive community actions. This innovative platform not only rewards users but also helps NGOs gain greater visibility and connect with students, fostering a collaborative environment for social good.
